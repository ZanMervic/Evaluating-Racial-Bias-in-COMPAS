# Evaluating Racial Bias in COMPAS Assessments and Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the code and Orange data mining workflows for a project called "Evaluating Racial Bias in COMPAS Assessments and Machine Learning Algorithms". The project was part of the course "Artificial Intelligence".

## Workflows

The workflows file contains the Orange data mining workflows used in the project. Each workflow is bound to a specific section of the project report. For the workflows to work, the Fairness Addon must be installed in Orange.

## Code

The Python file contains the Jupyter notebooks with the code used in the project. The code is prefixed with either "dressel_" or "rudin_" depending on which results it tries to reproduce. 

To run the Python code, multiple Python environments must be set up, as some packages are not compatible with each other.
A manual installation of the risk-slim package is also required. The package can be found at https://github.com/ustunb/risk-slim
